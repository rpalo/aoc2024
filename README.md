# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

Expects the directory of data files that comprise the input for each day in `./data`.

Run all days:

```
# on linux:
./aoc2024

# on anything else, requires deno
deno -A src/main.ts
```

Build the executable:

```
make
```

Run the unit tests:

```
make test

# or

deno test
```
